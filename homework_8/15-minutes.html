            Technica was a 24 hour all women/non-binary hackathon with over 700 participants. 
            I collaborated with 3 other students to build a mobile app aimed at helping people reach their long term goals. 
            I was the sole UX/UI designer on the team.<br><br>

          <p>Many people have a difficult time working towards their long term goals.
             There is no instant gratification for working towards long term goals,
              therefore people often neglect working towards them. 
              We want to build a system that can help them take small steps each day to help them make progress. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>I conducted semi-structured interviews with 2 people. Some questions I asked include: 
            What are some applications you use to organize your time? Do you have any long term goals that you are working towards? 
            How are you meeting those goals?What motivates you work on your long term goals?<br><br>

            I also did experiential research on based on apps that my users had as well as popular productivity apps in the App store.
            The apps that I studied were: Google Calendar, Habitica, StepBet and Habit.<br><br>
            
            After discussing my finding with my teammates, we were ideating for ways we can answer the "How Might We's."</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p><strong>How might we create a system where people can feel motivated to pursue their long term goals?</strong><br><br>

            When building the app, I wanted to focus on 2 key takeaways from the user research:<br>
            1. System needs a set time/schedule for the long term goals. People usually only log events and meetings on to their calendars, 
            which means that they always have to find time between the gaps of their schedule to work on their goals.<br>
             
            2. Users find that their peers are a strong source of motivation. Therefore, the app needs to have a strong sense of collaboration . </p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>
            1. To address the first issue, my team decided that users should set a time everyday dedicated to their long term goals. For example, everyday 6pm-7pm is for learning French. <br><br>
            2. To address the second issue, my team decided that users can add peers to the same long term goal. Friends added to the same goal will be able to keep track of the team's progress as well as keep each other accountable. <br><br>
            Before starting to prototype, I created a user flow.

            <strong>If I had more time:</strong><br>
            1. I would conduct more user testing on the prototype and complete more rounds of iteration<br>
            2. Design an onboarding system <br>
            3. Started off user testing using parallel testing rather than serial testing. <br>
            4. Added colors/illustrations for branding (I think that the UI could have more personality)<br><br>

            <strong>Takeaways:</strong><br>
            This was my first hackathon, and I was glad that I was able to work with a diverse group of people. 
            Two of my teammates were from Harvard University, and they focused on backend programming,
            while my third teammate was a high school senior who focused on the front-end. 
            There was a lot of time pressure because I needed to deliver my insights and designs to my team quickly, so that we can start brain storming a solution. 
            During the prototyping phase, I focused on four design principles: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. 
            These four principles are from The Non Designer's Design Book By Robin Williams.
            These principles are mentioned in the first chapter of the book, and I wanted to gain experience training my designer's eye. 
            I think that I could have been more bold by adding colors and being more creative. 
            However, considering that I want to work on the basics and fundamentals of design, I am pleased with how it turned out.
