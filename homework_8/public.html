        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>From previous research, we know that a primary reason for installing art in a city is that it increases the livability of a space. 
            People can feel a sense of connectedness to the community as well as the city. 
            It gives the city a landmark and people feel proud of living there. <br><br>

            Before our team got together as a group, each of us tried to understand the current state of public art using data from previous research. 
            We watched recordings of interviews, done experiential research and created stakeholder maps. 
            We were able to generate insights, create Usability Finding Templates (UFTs) and Data Visualizations.</p>

            <p>We conducted a Walk the Wall session and pinpointed common themes among our data.<br><br>
            <strong>Key takeaways from the Walk the Wall session:</strong><br>
            1. Storytelling is important for a viewer because it shows the significance of an art piece and allows them to understand its purpose. <br>
            2. During the creation of the artwork, the general public can contribute to the final outcome.<br>
            3. Art pieces can be dynamic (moving parts) and attract more users to interact with them.<br>
            4. There can be more interactions using mobile applications. The mobile apps that we explored are not very developed. <br>
            We think that mobile apps might increase interactions between viewers and the art.</p>

          <p> Our team also chose to do a reverse assumption activity in order to identify a problem space that we were interested in.

            We wanted allow the public to be able to participate in the creation of the artwork in some way. If the general public has a voice during the creation process, it ensures that public art is representative of the people.
            
            This lead to our problem:
            How might we encourage the communication between artists and viewers as well as viewers and viewers?</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
          The current state of public art has a problem: The intention of public art contradicts the reality of its experience.<br><br>

          The intention is that we see public art as something anyone can enjoy. There is no fee, no time limit and no barriers to enjoy public art. In other words, there is a low threshold of entry. However, the reality is that people think art has a high threshold of entry. People think that there are barriers between them and public art, which are preventing them from talking about public art with one another. The three barriers that we identified are: Prior Knowledge, Proximity, Privacy

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
          We found that people thought that they needed background knowledge to talk about public art with one another. They think that they need to be of a certain intellect or class to talk about it. These people also did know any suitable platform they can use to learn more about the art.

          People confine their experience with public art to when they were proximally close the art piece. The experience of public art ends whenever they leave the site. They will not talk about it with others unless they are at the site. During their daily lives, people will not talk about public art because they are not physically close to it.

          We saw that people thought that their art experience was a private and individual experience. They thought that they did not want their interpretations of the artwork to be influenced by others’ interpretations.

          <p><strong>Key Insights</strong><br>
            The topic of public art has a perceived certain threshold that allows people to engage with or talk about it.<br><br>
            
            The level of exposure to public art is influenced by people’s daily routines. We observed that the measure of how often one views public art is dependent on where people go on a daily basis.<br>
            
            We found that people enjoy novel interactions with public art. Our users think that public art should be more than a simple painting. It should be more dynamic rather than static and be creative with the medium/container of the artwork.</p>

            <strong>Insights</strong><br>
            It was difficult for the user to browse through the art pieces, making it hard to identify a specific art piece and related art pieces. (UFT #1)<br>
            Solution: Provide a filter and sort system to personalize the users’ interests and help them identify art pieces that they probably like, so that they would be more willing to talk/contribute their thoughts on art pieces.<br><br>

            Users couldn’t easily identify the location of the art pieces (UFT’s #3 and #8).<br>
            Solution:  Implement real-time ETA to the art piece based on user’s location or include a short, concise address with an interactive map on the site<br><br>

            Users find it hard to understand art pieces without knowing the contexts of art pieces (UFT #9)<br>
            Solution: Provide a communication tunnel for viewers and they are able to ask questions on the page if any information they would like to know is lacking on the website.

          The main concern for users when interacting with the artist or artist’s work were:<br><br>
          
          1. Users need privacy, otherwise they prefer not to participate<br>
          2. Users need useful visual and contextual information delivered in a non-intrusive medium<br>
